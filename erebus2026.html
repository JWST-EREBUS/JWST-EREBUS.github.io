        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <!--<p>
        Since the first EREBUS collaboration meeting in February 2017, subsequent meetings have been held at Ringberg Castle (Germany) in March 2020 and October 2022 in preparation for JWST Cycles 1 and 2; in Tucson (USA) in October 2023 for JWST Cycle 3; in Hilo (USA) in September 2024 in preparation for the JWST Cycle 4 call for proposals; and in Bologna (Italy) to prepare JWST Cycle 5 proposals and the JWST Cycle 3 COSMOS-3D large program. Thanks to these community efforts, the EREBUS team has gained a leadership position in the exploitation of JWST for the study of high-redshift quasars, with many programs approved across multiple cycles.
        </p>-->
        <p>
        The 2026 EREBUS Collaboration Meeting aims to facilitate in-depth discussions of the scientific exploitation of ongoing JWST programs led by the EREBUS team, and to plan future
        large-scale initiatives with <strong>JWST, Euclid, Rubin, and Roman</strong>. With the start of Euclid and Rubin science operations,
        and the forthcoming launch of Roman, we are entering a transformative period that offers unprecedented opportunities to expand our understanding of the early Universe.
        The meeting will include dedicated sessions focused on how the collaboration can continue to lead studies of high-redshift quasars, AGNs, and galaxies in the
        data intensive era, while strategically preparing for synergies with the next generation of extremely large telescopes.
        </p>
        <p>
        This meeting will be held in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA, home to the University of Michigan. The <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/astro" target="_blank">University of Michigan Department of Astronomy</a>
        is an active member of four international consortia developing instrumentation for the European Southern Observatory’s
        Extremely Large Telescope, which is currently planning for science operations in 2029. The department is committed to maintain a supportive and welcoming climate, and embrace the goal of training
        the next generations of astronomers. These values closely align with the EREBUS collaboration’s vision of promoting scientific discovery while cultivating a supportive community for early-career
        researchers. Hosting the collaboration meeting on the University of Michigan campus therefore provides an excellent setting for advancing EREBUS’s scientific and community-building goals in this exciting era.
        </p>
        <p>
        We gratefully acknowledge the strong support provided by the Space Telescope Science Institute and the Department of Astronomy, University of Michigan! <span style="color:#00274C; font-weight:bold;">Go Blue! Astronomy is for everyone!</span>

        <p>
        Most 3-star+ hotels in Ann Arbor are quite expensive in August, so sharing rooms is an excellent option. On a more budget-friendly side, <span style="background-color:#FFCB05; color:#00274C; font-weight: bold;"> there are a few cheaper options </span> on South State Street close to the I-94 and the Briarwood Mall.

        <h2>Food and Transportation</h2>
        <p>
        <strong>Transportation to/from Airport:</strong> You can find lots of information on the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/lctp/visitor-information.html" target="_blank">LCTP visitor info site</a>. The closest airport is the Detroit Metro International Airport (DTW), which is 30-40 mins away by bus/taxi/Uber and has good flight connections worldwide.
        <ul>
            <li><span style="color:#00274C; font-weight: bold;">Michigan Flyer bus</li> The cheapest way to get from the airport to the city is <a href="https://www.michiganflyer.com/" target="_blank">Michigan Flyer bus</a>. The cost is about $15, and you can book your seat online ahead of time. The bus runs from both terminals at DTW and drops you off at Blake Transit Center in downtown Ann Arbor, a relatively short walk from the site of the central campus. In case your lodging is not within walking distance from there, taking the Flyer to Ann Arbor and then getting an Uber ride to the hotel is a good option. The schedule of the bus can be found <a href="https://www.michiganflyer.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. For arriving in Ann Arbor, refer to the Westbound table. For returning to DTW, refer to the Eastbound one.
            <li><span style="color:#00274C; font-weight: bold;">Other ways to get to Ann Arbor</li>An Uber/Lyft ride from the airport costs $50-60. A taxi should cost $70 or so. If you want to travel in style, a <a href="https://dtwtaxilimo.com" target="_blank">Metrocar</a> (with a uniformed driver) should cost slightly more, in the $85 ballpark.
        </ul>
