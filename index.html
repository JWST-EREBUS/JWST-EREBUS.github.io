        <h2>About the Collaboration</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>EREBUS Collaboration</strong> has been a long journey in the making, beginning with our first JWST workshop on Santa Barbara Street in February 2017,
            and continuing through the memorable Ringberg Black Hole meeting in March 2020. This collaboration was officially formed in August 2022 by merging teams from two JWST Cycle 1 medium-size programs:
            <strong>Quasar Frontier (GO 1764)</strong> and <strong>ASPIRE (GO 2078)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
        We got our first JWST data in August 2022 and initiated five dedicated working groups, each focused on a specific research area, with the five PIs of the two JWST programs serving as the steering committee. These working groups coordinate discussions on projects and papers. Each steering committee member has committed to overseeing the activities of one of these five working groups: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Black Hole Mass and AGN Physics (Coordinator: Eduardo Bañados)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Galaxies and Ancillary Science (Coordinator: Xiaohui Fan)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Quasar Environment and Large-Scale Structure (Coordinator: Feige Wang)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Quasar Host Galaxies (Coordinator: Jinyi Yang)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Reionization and the Intergalactic Medium (Coordinator: Joseph Hennawi)</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        We have made many exciting scientific discoveries and have had many more JWST programs, as well as other multi-wavelength follow-up programs, approved.
        Our collaboration continues to grow and has now attracted more than 100 scientists, including a significant fraction of students and postdocs.
        The working groups and their research topics also continue to evolve over time. In preparation for the upcoming large-scale surveys with <strong>Euclid, Roman, and Rubin</strong>,
        the collaboration is positioning itself to enter a new stage of cosmic discoveries.

        <h2>Approved JWST programs</h2>
        <h3>Quasar frontier program  (GO 1764)</h3>
        <p>
        <strong>Principal Investigator (PI):</strong> Xiaohui Fan, Jinyi Yang, and Eduardo Banados<br>
            The Quasar frontier program is a JWST Cycle 1 program which performs a comprehensive study of the three most
            distant quasars. By employing a combination of imaging and spectroscopic observations using NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI and
            NIRISS, this program will (1) detect the stellar continuum and nebular emission of quasar host galaxies only 680 Myr after the Big Bang, to probe
            host galaxy assembly and to search for signatures of outflow and feedback, (2) map the large scale quasar environment, to test quasar formation
            models in the context of early structure formation, (3) yield reliable estimates of the SMBH masses and constrain physical properties of the quasar
            broad-line regions, and (4) provide the most accurate measurement of the IGM neutral fraction at z=7.5 and detect weak metal absorption features, to
            map the history of reionization and IGM enrichment.

        <h3>ASPIRE program  (GO 2078)</h3>
        <p>
        <strong>Principal Investigator (PI):</strong> Feige Wang, Joseph Hennawi, and Xiaohui Fan<br>
        This is a multiwavelength redshift survey with observations of 25 quasars at z>6.5.  It will
        resolve the long-standing question of whether the earliest supermassive black holes (SMBHs) reside in the most massive dark matter halos
        and inhabit large scale galaxy overdensities. This program will simultaneously image the host galaxies and close companions of quasars,
        measure the masses of the central SMBHs and characterize quasar feedback, providing unprecedented constraints on the connection between
        SMBHs and their hosts as well as their primordial environment. This program will also provide unparalleled constraints on cosmic reionization and
        galaxy formation by measuring ionizing photon escape fractions of faint galaxies and probing the circumgalactic media of high-redshift galaxies.
